## AutomatiCat

The AutomatiCat dataset and catalog demonstrate automated integration of dataset management,
metadata extraction, and catalog generation using the free and open source DataLad ecosystem.
DataLad is used for decentralised management of data as lightweight, portable and extensible
representations. DataLad-Metalad then extracts structured high- and low-level metadata and
associates it with these datasets and their individual files. And at the end of the workflow,
Datalad-Catalog turns the structured metadata into the user-friendly data browser that you
can view at https://jsheunis.github.io/automaticat-demo.
